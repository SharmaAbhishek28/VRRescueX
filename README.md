## Overview

VRRescueX is an advanced Virtual Reality (VR) training simulator designed specifically for National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) jawans. Focused on CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) disaster management, this project aims to revolutionize training methodologies by providing an immersive, realistic, and adaptable learning environment.

## Features

- Realistic Simulation: Experience lifelike scenarios based on NDRF protocols, enhancing training effectiveness.

- Adaptive Training: Customize scenarios to cater to different operational environments and disaster types.

- Equipment Handling: Familiarize jawans with specialized CBRN response equipment through realistic simulations.

- Multiplayer Collaboration: Foster teamwork and communication skills through collaborative virtual scenarios.

- Immediate Feedback: Receive real-time feedback to correct actions and reinforce proper protocols during simulations.

- Stress Inoculation: Prepare jawans for high-pressure situations by simulating stress-inducing scenarios in a controlled environment.

- Certification Modules: Validate proficiency with certification modules, ensuring readiness for actual CBRN emergencies.

- Continuous Learning: Engage in ongoing learning and skill development with regular updates and new scenario additions.
